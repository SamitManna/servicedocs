Please perform during off hours. Please contact your Philips Remote Installation Engineer. The Philips Remote Installation Engineer will be accessing a web application to verify installation and configuration settings. Identify the correct ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter to be installed via MAC address or serial number. The MAC address and serial number can be located on the bottom of the unit. Plug the barrel connector of the power supply into the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Plug the other end into the Imaging Equipment rack PDU using a NEMA 5-15R to C14 adapter cable. The LED indicator on the front of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter should light up green. Find the network cable provided by the customer. Plug this into the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. The LED indicators on the network port of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter should start flashing after 2 minutes. Locate the correct video splitter for this modality by referencing your [Configuration Sheet Name]. Connect the video splitter power into the Imaging Equipment rack PDU using a NEMA 5-15R to C14 adapter cable. The LED indicator should on. If the Imaging Console Computer is dual video, you will need to connect and power up two video splitters. Connect a video cable from the second output port of the video splitter(s) to the previously installed video input port of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Verify what the video cable from the Imaging Console Computer is connected to. If you are in an equipment room, it will typically be connected to a video extender. Locate the video extender. If you are at the Technologist desk the video cable from the Imaging Console Computer should be connected to a computer monitor. Disconnect the video cable from the video extender or the computer monitor. Connect this cable to the input port of the video splitter(s). Using a new video cable please connect one end to the first output of the video splitter(s). Please connect the other end to the video extender or the computer monitor. Locate a USB Type B to USB Type A cable. Connect the type B side to the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Connect the type A side to an open USB 2.0 port on Imaging Console Computer. Note that USB 2.0 ports are typically black and USB 3.0 ports are typically blue. Proceed to verify normal functionality at the Technologist desk. If there is no image on the Technologist Desk monitor the EDID setting will need to be configured on the video splitter. Please see EDID setting instructions in the Appendix. Once normal functionality at the Technologist desk is verified please contact your Philips Remote Installation Engineer so they can verify connectivity from the ROCC Central Manager to the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter.

Please perform during off hours. Please contact your Philips Remote Installation Engineer. The Philips Remote Installation Engineer will be accessing a web application to verify installation and configuration settings. Identify the correct ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter to be installed via MAC address or serial number. The MAC address and serial number can be located on the bottom of the unit. Plug the barrel connector of the power supply into the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Plug the other end into the Imaging Equipment rack PDU using a NEMA 5-15R to C14 adapter cable. The LED indicator on the front of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter should light up green. Find the network cable provided by the customer. Plug this into the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. The LED indicators on the network port of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter should start flashing after 2 minutes. Locate the correct video splitter for this modality by referencing your [Configuration Sheet Name]. Connect the video splitter power into the Imaging Equipment rack PDU using a NEMA 5-15R to C14 adapter cable. The LED indicator should on. If the Imaging Console Computer is dual video, you will need to connect and power up two video splitters. Connect a video cable from the second output port of the video splitter(s) to the previously installed video input port of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Verify what the video cable from the Imaging Console Computer is connected to. If you are in an equipment room, it will typically be connected to a video extender. Locate the video extender. If you are at the Technologist desk the video cable from the Imaging Console Computer should be connected to a computer monitor. Disconnect the video cable from the video extender or the computer monitor. Connect this cable to the input port of the video splitter(s). Using a new video cable please connect one end to the first output of the video splitter(s). Please connect the other end to the video extender or the computer monitor. Locate a USB Type B to USB Type A cable. Connect the type B side to the back of the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter. Connect the type A side to an open USB 2.0 port on Imaging Console Computer. Note that USB 2.0 ports are typically black and USB 3.0 ports are typically blue. Proceed to verify normal functionality at the Technologist desk. If there is no image on the Technologist Desk monitor the EDID setting will need to be configured on the video splitter. Please see EDID setting instructions in the Appendix. Once normal functionality at the Technologist desk is verified please contact your Philips Remote Installation Engineer so they can verify connectivity from the ROCC Central Manager to the ROCC Relay Spoke Transmitter.

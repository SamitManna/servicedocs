#### Dual Screen view via remote app

1. When Smart sizing is enabled, it fits the remote screen to the local display. So for dual output It compresses both the screens to be presented within our single monitor. In a laptop, this becomes extremely skewed/stretched.

#### Smart Sizing 

1. If Smart sizing is disabled, it displays at actual size. For dual head – the view will make sense only if we have another monitor – then we can extend the display and have each screen output in one monitor. In this mode, even a single screen looks too large on a laptop
